# ESP8266-Morse-Code Blinker
ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to convert text input into Morse code and blink an LED accordingly. Users can input a message via the Serial Monitor, and the ESP8266 will translate it into Morse code, controlling an LED to blink dots (short blinks) and dashes (long blinks). Additionally, a simple web interface allows users to control LED states remotely.
